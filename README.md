# mitx-sds-resources
Supplemental resources for courses in the [MITx MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science](https://micromasters.mit.edu/ds/).

This repo serves to host a [wiki](https://github.com/roadfoodr/mitx-sds-resources/wiki) of links to resources.

What is included:
* Links to materials that supplement, illuminate or otherwise help to understand topics in the courses

What is not included:
* Reposts of course material, or copies of any other material (add a link to the material rather than copying it here)
* Solutions to any course exercises, homework or exam questions (or links to material that directly provides any of those solutions)

This is intended to be a collaborative resource!  Learners are encouraged to contribute to the wiki within the parameters above.  _(Go ahead, click the **Edit** button on any wiki page!)_  Let's try to keep it focused with all the "good stuff".
